![hacktoberfest-meetup(2)(1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37214399/195259013-eb50cf1a-3e90-4566-9313-1821df0d37a7.png)
A content writing contest by OSDC to help kickstart your open source journey through non-code contributions as a part of Hacktoberfest.

## Prompt
> Normal college working day, you have infinite budget and infinite resources and the confined space of Cafe (Annapurna, ABB-III). You're given full freedom to renovate it for a day and make something happen. What do you do?

Weave a short story around the prompt in around 100-200 words.

## How to Participate:
1) Fork the repository.
2) Clone your fork locally using `git clone <forkURL>`
3) Go to the `content/posts/` folder and add your properly formatted markdown file `<ASuitableTitle>.md` with your entry in it.
(You won't be able to write markdown files with notepad, consider using something like nano, VSCode or one of the many [online in-browser markdown editors](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown+file+editor+online))
4) Add untracked files (`git add *`), commit (`git commit -m "Added entry."`), push (`git push`) and make a PR.

## Format for markdown file
```md
+++
title = "title in double quotes"
date = "2022-07-14T10:37:16"
author = "name in double quotes"
discord = "your discord username and tag in double quotes"
+++
